/*
* One of the main uses of a atomic types is to implement syncronization
* perimitives such as semaphores and mutexes. It is also useul to implement
* lock-free algorithms.
*
* Task: In this exersise we implement a lock-free stack using an atomic reference.
* Assume that you have a class implementing an atomic refrence called
* SimpleAtomicReference with an interface as follows:
*
* class SimpleAtomicReference[V](initValue: V) {
*  protected var value:V
*
*  def compareAndSet(expect: V, update: V): Boolean
*  def get: V
*  def set(newValue: V): Unit
*}
*
* Hint: refer and use compareAndSet(expect: V, update: V): Boolean method from
* past exercises.
